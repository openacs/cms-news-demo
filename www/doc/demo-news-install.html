Arsdigita Content Management System.
<p>








<h4>Where to get the CMS News Site Demo</h4>

There are two options for obtaining the CMS News Demo:

<ol>

<li>Download a tarball from 
  <a href="http://cms.arsdigita.com/download.html">cms.arsdigita.com</a>.
<p>

<li>Checkout the latest version from the CVS repository:
  <ul><tt>cvs -d :ext:ls.arsdigita.com:/cvsweb/ co cms-news-demo</tt></ul>
<p>

</ol>


<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<ol>

<li> The CMS 4.1 package is mounted onto ACS 4.1.<p>
  Packages can be mounted in $YOURSERVER/admin/site-map/.  You must be
  logged in as a site-wide administrator to mount a package.
<p>

<li> The CMS News Site Demo 1.2 package is mounted onto ACS 4.1.<p>
  Packages can be mounted in $YOURSERVER/admin/site-map/.  You must be
  logged in as a site-wide administrator to mount a package.
<p>

<li> The CMS News Site Demo 1.2 data model is loaded.<p>
  If the data model wasn't loaded when installing ACS 4.1, then you can
  load it manually:<p>
  <ul><tt>cd $CMS_NEWS_DEMO_ROOT/sql<br>
          sqlplus $DB_USER/$DB_PASSWD < cms-news-demo-create.sql</tt></ul>
<p>


<p>

<li> You are a registered user and have CMS Administrative privileges 
  on the entire Content Management System.<p>
  If no user is registered to CMS with Administrative privileges, then the
  next user to register under CMS will automatically be granted Administrative 
  privileges on the entire CMS.
<p>

</ol>

<p>




<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>

<ol>

<li>Browse to $YOUR_SERVER/cms-news-demo/install-wizard to start the
