     site usually incorporates Articles, Images, and Multimedia Files into its
     repository.

   from scratch, that is, designate Authors, Editors,
     Publishers, Template Developers, etc.
 <li>Design the overall site flow.
 <li>Design templates for displaying the content on the public site.
 <li>Design custom forms (templates) for generating the content.
 <li>Create data model for the content types. The data model
     should include how the different content types are related and how the
     content will be inserted into the database.
</ul>

<h4>Writing the Public Pages</h4>

 <li>Write the templates to display dynamic content on the public pages.

<h4>Content Management</h4>

    public site.

    files) that eventually will be revised by the Author and Editor.

    create content via the workflow engine.
  <li>The Author writes and uploads articles. The Photographer uploads
    images and multimedia files.

    the content to the file system and to the live site.
